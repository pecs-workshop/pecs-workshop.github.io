## Paper Preparation

Papers must present novel contributions and must not have been submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers must be written in English with a minimum length of {{edition.min_pagelimit}} pages and a maximum length of {{edition.max_pagelimit}} pages, including text, references, appendices and figures. Papers with less than {{edition.min_pagelimit}} pages are considered short and can be presented at the workshop, but they will not appear in the workshop proceedings. Papers should be formatted according to [Spinger LNCS Proceedings Guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines){:target="_blank"}.

PECS uses <u>double-blind peer review</u>, i.e. the identity of authors and reviewers will not be revealed to each other. Therefore, all information that may allow authors to be identified should be removed from the submitted paper, such as authors' names and affiliations, acknowledgements, funding information, and all references to authors' work that may reveal their identity. This information may be added later to accepted papers.



## Paper Submission

All papers must be submitted using [EasyChair submission system]({{edition.submission_link}}){:target="_blank"}.


## Paper Reviewing

All submitted papers will undergo a double-blind review process.


## Paper Publication

Workshop proceedings will be published in a dedicated Springer LNCS volume. Only accepted papers presented at the workshop by a registered author will be published in the workshop proceedings (excluding short papers).
