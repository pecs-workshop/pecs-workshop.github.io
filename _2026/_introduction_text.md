Nowadays, concurrent and distributed systems play a role in a variety of computing applications. This is supported by the widespread use of computing architectures based on multi-core processors or distributed computing units, which have become a de facto standard at any system scale.

However, the increasing level of hardware parallelism and heterogeneity has made concurrent and distributed systems even more challenging to design, analyse and optimize. In particular, this concerns factors like performance and energy efficiency, which are known to be highly interrelated. Nevertheless, they play key roles, especially given the recent rise in energy demand from many IT applications. Examples include AI model training and inference, Big Data Analytics, high-performance computing and simulation, cryptography, high-resolution video encoding, and many more besides.

In concurrent and distributed systems, energy efficiency and performance are affected in complex ways by multiple factors, such as the concurrent use of computing resources, the distributed communication, the presence of (distributed) data dependencies and the need to synchronize the execution of concurrent threads/processes. However, these and other factors also offer opportunities to be explored in the design of techniques and tools for improving both energy efficiency and performance.
