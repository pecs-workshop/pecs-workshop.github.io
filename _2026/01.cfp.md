PECS aims to establish a venue for both academia and industry to discuss challenges and perspectives, and to explore methods, techniques and tools for energy efficiency and performance analysis and optimization in concurrent and distributed systems.

PECS calls for high-quality research papers on all aspects of energy efficiency, performance and their interrelations in concurrent and/or distributed computing systems, focusing on (but not limited to) the following topics:
 
 - Energy efficiency and performance analysis, modeling and evaluation in concurrent and distributed systems and architectures 
 - Energy-Aware programming and green software design methods for concurrent and distributed systems
 - Energy efficiency and performance trade-offs in parallel and distributed AI model training and inference
 - GreenOps for concurrent and distributed software systems and architectures
 - Analysis and optimization of energy efficiency and performance in heterogeneous computing architectures
 - Energy-efficient and performance optimized algorithms and frameworks for (Big) Data Processing
 - Energy efficiency in high-performance computing platforms and applications
 - Energy efficiency and performance aspects in Cloud, IoT, Edge, Fog computing, and Computing Continuum
 - Approaches and techniques for improving energy efficiency and performance in data management and services
 - Energy efficiency and performance evaluation and optimization in operating systems, networks and virtualized systems
 - Energy usage evaluation and optimization in concurrent and distributed algorithms for cybersecurity 

{{site.title}} is colocated with the 32th International European Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing ([Euro-PAR](https://2026.euro-par.org/){:target="_blank"}).
