PECS aims to establish a venue for both academia and industry to discuss challenges and perspectives, and to explore methods, techniques and tools for energy efficiency and performance analysis and optimization in concurrent and distributed systems.

PECS calls for high-quality research papers on all aspects of energy efficiency, performance and their interrelations in concurrent and/or distributed computing systems, focusing on (but not limited to) the following topics:
 
 - Energy efficiency and performance analysis, modeling and evaluation in concurrent and distributed systems and architectures 
 - Energy-Aware programming and green software design methods for concurrent and distributed systems
 - Energy efficiency and performance trade-offs in parallel and distributed AI model training and inference
 - GreenOps for concurrent and distributed software systems and architectures
 - Analysis and optimization of energy efficiency and performance in heterogeneous computing architectures
 - Energy-efficient and performance optimized algorithms and frameworks for (Big) Data Processing
 - Energy efficiency in high-performance computing platforms and applications
 - Energy efficiency and performance aspects in Cloud, IoT, Edge, Fog computing, and Computing Continuum
 - Approaches and techniques for improving energy efficiency and performance in data management and services
 - Energy efficiency and performance evaluation and optimization in operating systems, networks and virtualized systems
 - Energy usage evaluation and optimization in concurrent and distributed algorithms for cybersecurity 

{{site.title}} is colocated with the 32th International European Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing ([Euro-PAR](https://2026.euro-par.org/){:target="_blank"}).

## Important Dates

{% include_relative _important_dates.md %}


## Paper Submission

All papers must be submitted using [EasyChair submission system]({{edition.submission_link}}){:target="_blank"}.


## Paper Preparation

Papers should present novel contributions and should not have been submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers must be written in English, with a minimum length of {{edition.min_pagelimit}} pages and a maximum length of {{edition.max_pagelimit}} pages, including text, references, appendices and figures. Papers with less than {{edition.min_pagelimit}} pages are considered short and can be presented at the workshop, but they will not appear in the workshop proceedings. Papers should be formatted according to [Spinger LNCS Proceedings Guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines){:target="_blank"}.

PECS uses <u>double-blind peer review</u>, i.e. the identity of authors and reviewers will not be revealed to each other. Therefore, all information that may allow authors to be identified should be removed from the submitted paper, such as authors' names and affiliations, acknowledgements, funding information, and all references to authors' work that may reveal their identity. This information may be added later to accepted papers.

There is no specific structure for organizing papers, however authors are encouraged to prepare them in a way to clearly outline the following aspects (where relevant): 

- Motivation of the study presented in the paper
- Limitations of existing studies, approaches, or solutions
- The novel contribution of the presented study
- Methodology and tools used in the presented study
- Availability of the artifacts and tools used in the study 
- Validity and limitations of the presented study

The relevant aspects indicated above will be taken into consideration by the reviewers during the evaluation process.

The use of any AI-generated content (text, images, data, etc.) must be clearly disclosed in the acknowledgments section, except if AI-tools are used for simple sentence checking and grammatical corrections. Authors are solely responsible for the content of their articles.


## Paper Reviewing

All submitted papers will undergo a double-blind review process.


## Paper Publication

Workshop proceedings will be published in a dedicated Springer LNCS volume. Only accepted papers presented at the workshop by a registered author will be published in the workshop proceedings (excluding short papers).
