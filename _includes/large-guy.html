Use this include in the following way. It is possible to specify
any number of additional lines, to sketch more precise affiliations,
or whatever is needed, without changing the include.
Pictures should be placed in /assets/img/people/.

{% assign moreinfo = "This is the very first line|This is the second|And that's the third" | split: '|' %}
{% include large-guy.html   name="Guybrush Threepwood"
                            picture="Guy.brush"
                            url="http://vodoo.lady"
