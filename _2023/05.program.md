| | Title. Boosting the performance and efficiency of software and hardware designs with Cache-aware Roofline Model |
| | *Aleksandar Ilic, Universidade de Lisboa, INESC-ID, Lisbon* |
| |Abstract. In the first part of this talk, we will introduce the Cache-aware Roofline Model (CARM) and expose its basic principles when modelling the performance, power consumption and energy-efficiency upper-bounds of a processor. In the second part of this talk, we will showcase the ability of the CARM to drive the optimization of epistasis detection, an important application in bioinformatics. For both CPU and GPU devices, we will demonstrate how the CARM can be used to detect execution bottlenecks and provide useful hints on which type of optimizations to apply in order to fully exploit device capabilities. We will also discuss our recent research contributions in CARM-driven RISC-V hardware design, as well as several model extensions to improve its insightfulness for specialised hardware and applications, such as NPUs and sparse computations.||
