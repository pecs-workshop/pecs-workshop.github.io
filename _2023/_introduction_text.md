Concurrent and distributed computer architectures, based on multi/many-core or distributed computer units, have become a standard de-facto in computer systems. Today, these architectures take a role at any scale, from high-end servers to personal and mobile devices, and they underlie various recent computing paradigms, like Cloud, Edge and Fog Computing.

The continuously-growing level of hardware parallelism and heterogeneity has led concurrent and distributed systems to be even more complex to optimize, in particular in terms of energy efficiency and performance, which are known to be highly interrelated. Nonetheless, these aspects are of paramount importance, especially because of the high demand for electricity by IT sector. This facet is further exacerbated by the recent energy crisis and the rising energy prices.

Actually, various aspects of concurrent and/or distributed systems that make complex to deal with them (like the complexity of the underlying architectures, data dependencies, the use of shared resources, the hardware heterogeneity) can also offer new opportunities for designing novel methods and techniques for their energy and performance optimization.
