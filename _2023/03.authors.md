## Important Dates

{% include_relative _important_dates.md %}

## Paper Preparation

Papers must be prepared by using an official [Springer LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). 
Please make sure that your paper strictly adheres to the Springer LNCS style by using one of the provided template files.

Papers must be written in English with minimum length of 10 pages and maximum length of {{edition.pagelimit}} pages, including text, references, appendices and figures. 

Due to <u>double-blind peer review</u>, all information that may allow to identify the authors must be removed from the manuscript, like authors’ names and affiliations, acknowledgments, funding information, and all references to the authors’ work that may disclose their identity. This information can be later added to accepted manuscripts. 

## Paper Submission

Papers should present novel contributions and should not have been submitted for publication elsewhere. 

Papers must be submitted using the EasyChair submission system:

## Paper Reviewing

All submissions will be reviewed through a double-blind review process, i.e. the identity of authors and referees will not be revealed to each other.


## Paper Publication

Only the accepted papers presented at the workshop will be published in the final proceedings by Springer in the LNCS series.
