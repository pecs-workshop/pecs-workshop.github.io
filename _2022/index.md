The {{ year }} {{site.description}} ({{site.title}}) will take place as a **{{ edition.location }}** on {{ edition.dates }}. The workshop will be co-located with the [12th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering](https://icpe2021.spec.org/).

Concurrent systems, based on (distributed) multi/many-core processing units, are the nowadays reference computing architecture. The (continuously-growing) level of hardware parallelism they offer has lead these platforms to play a central role at any scale, ranging from data centers, to personal (mobile) devices. Optimizing performance and/or ensuring energy efficiency when running complex software stacks on top of these systems is extremely challenging due to several aspects, like data dependencies or resource sharing (and interference) among application threads, as well as VMs. Furthermore, hardware accelerators like GPGPUs or FPGAs introduce a level of heterogeneity that can potentially offer further opportunities for combined gain in performance and energy efficiency, if correctly exploited.

The goal of this workshop is to establish a venue for both academia and industry experts and practitioners, where they can discuss challenges, perspectives and opportunities given by researching on scalable, energy-efficient and secure software deployed on top of modern (heterogeneous) concurrent platforms.

## Virtual Event

Given the uncertainty around the COVID pandemic, and also considering the success and the positive feedback of the previous edition, the {{ year }} {{site.description}} ({{site.title}}) will take place as a **virtual event**. We also consider this as an opportunity to foster a broader participation in the workshop.
