# Change this to the year which shall appear as "default" in the website

# The following array is used to populate previous editions.
# If the edition is hosted by this site, a corresponding _edition_20xx
# folder is expected to be found, and `output: true` should be set.
# Otherwise, `site` should point to the previous webpage (if available).
# `proceedings` should point to the digital library page of the proceedings (if availbale).
# `venue`, `location`, and `dates` allow to customize the edition website. The current
# markdown files rely on them throughout the text, so if you clone the content of a past
# edition and set these variables correctly, a good part of the site is already consistent.
