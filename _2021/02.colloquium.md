The Ph.D. Colloquium and Poster Session at the {{ year }} ACM SIGSIM PADS is an exciting opportunity for Ph.D. students to present their work to the research community. Presenting your Ph.D. work to your peers and supporting society members will give you valuable feedback, support your research with additional ideas and parallel ongoing work, and introduces you to a network that can be very helpful with your career once you graduate.

Each student interested in participating is required to submit an Abstract with no more than 500 words according to the instructions given below.

Students notified that their abstract has been accepted will also be required to:

- prepare a short presentation to be given at the Ph.D. Colloquium.
- bring a poster to the conference to be presented in the poster session of the conference, prepared according to the guidelines given below.

ACM SIGSIM will provide a complimentary one-year membership to all students participating in the Colloquium. One student presenter will be selected to receive the ACM SIGSIM PADS Ph.D. Colloquium Award. A limited number of travel grants are available as detailed below.

## Student Travel Grants

This year, we will have the availability of two types of Student Travel Grants.

### ACM SIGSIM Student Travel Grants

ACM SIGSIM will provide a limited number of travel grants of $1,000 to help defray the costs of attending the conference to students participating in the colloquium. The list of materials required for a travel grant application is [provided here](https://www.acm-sigsim-mskr.org/studentTravelAwardsCall.htm): The application material can be submitted as a single zip file to [David Bell](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/people/david-bell) via email by April 3, 2020.

### NSF Student Travel Grants

Five student travel grants are sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). To qualify, a student must be a full-time student at a U.S. institution. Priorities will be given to students from under-represented groups (e.g., women, minorities and people with disabilities). Student recipients will be reimbursed (based on valid receipts) after the conference. In order to have their airfare to be reimbursed, students must book their flights from U.S.-based carriers. \
Students receiving travel grants may be asked to offer some assistance to the conference organizers and SIGSIM at the conference.

## Submission Instructions

All colloquium submissions should include an Abstract with no more than 500 words describing the research to be presented in the Poster Session along with the names of your co-authors. A full-paper submission is not required for participating at the colloquium. Your topic must be within the [PADS program scope](01.cfp.md).

We welcome abstracts about already-published work. Please specify that in your abstract.

## Content Guidelines

- While some context should be given, the main content of the presentation and poster should be concrete enough to enable discussions on (potential or already defined) research questions, approaches, and methods.
- If you also present a full-paper or short-paper, your Ph.D. Colloquium submission should be clearly differentiated. For instance, the Ph.D. Colloquium is a good opportunity to go into aspects not covered in detail in the presentation of your regular submission or to discuss directions and early results towards future work.

Please submit your abstract as a PDF file through the [Ph.D. Colloquium Submission Form.](https://forms.gle/d4o5HCKr1a2o2dE4A)

For questions, please contact the Ph.D. Colloquium Chair [Hamdi Kavak](http://hamdikavak.com/).
