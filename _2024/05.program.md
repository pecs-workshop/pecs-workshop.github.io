| | Title: Energy-Efficient Computing across the Software Stack
| | *Speaker: [Biagio Cosenza](https://www.cosenza.eu/) - University of Salerno - Dipartimento di Informatica*
| | *Abstract: Energy efficient computing is a major challenge for exascale computing. Power constraints, rising electricity costs, and the diminishing efficiency benefits of Moore's Law have exacerbated this challenge and increased the need for energy-efficient technologies. This talk will present state-of-the-art software approaches aimed at minimizing the energy consumption of HPC applications. We will discuss some common misconceptions about energy optimization and provide insights into understanding when optimizing for energy differs from optimizing for performance. We will see how different approaches in HPC can target energy optimization from different perspectives, such as job schedulers, compilers, and operating systems. Finally, we will see how recent research is targeting solutions that go beyond the stack with approaches such as SYnergy [SC23], which includes programming models, compilers, runtime, and job schedulers, while also addressing heterogeneous computing systems.*
