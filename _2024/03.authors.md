## Paper Preparation

Submitted papers must be prepared using the sigconf style, available [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

Papers must be written in English with a minimum length of 5 pages and a maximum length of 8 pages, including text, references, appendices and figures.

Due to the double-blind peer review, all information that may allow to identify the authors must be removed from the submitted paper, like authors’ names and affiliations, acknowledgments, funding information, and all references to the authors’ work that may disclose their identity. This information can be later added to accepted papers.

## Paper Submission


All papers must be submitted using [HotCRP]({{edition.submission_link}}).


## Paper Reviewing

Submitted papers will undergo a double-blind review process, i.e. the identity of authors and referees will not be revealed to each other.


## Paper Publication

Only the accepted papers presented at the workshop will be published in the final proceedings.
