Concurrent and distributed architectures, based on multi/many-core or distributed computer units, have become a standard de-facto in modern computer systems. Today, these architectures take a role at any scale, from high-end servers to personal and mobile devices, and they underlie various recent computing paradigms, like Cloud, Edge and Fog Computing.

However, the continuously-growing level of hardware parallelism and heterogeneity has led concurrent and distributed systems to be even more complex to analyze and optimize. In particular, this concerns energy efficiency and performance aspects, which are known to be highly interrelated. Nonetheless, they play an important role, also because of the global electricity demand by the IT sector. 

In concurrent and distributed systems, there are various other factors whose impact on energy efficiency and performance is complex to understand, such as concurrent use of computing resources,  distributed communication, the presence of (distributed) data dependencies, and the need for synchronization of concurrent threads/processes. However, these and other aspects also offer new opportunities to be explored in the design of methods and tools to improve energy efficiency and performance of these systems.
