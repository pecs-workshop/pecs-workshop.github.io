Today, concurrent and distributed software and hardware systems take place in most computing applications, as well as they play a central role in recent computing paradigms like cloud, edge, and fog computing.

However, the increasing level of parallelism and heterogeneity has made concurrent and distributed systems even more complex to analyze and optimize. In particular, this concerns energy efficiency and performance aspects, which are known to be highly interrelated. Nonetheless, they play an important role, also because of the global electricity demand by the IT sector. 

In concurrent and distributed systems, there are various factors that affect energy efficiency and performance in a complex way, such as the concurrent use of computing resources, distributed communication, the presence of (distributed) data dependencies and the need for synchronization of concurrent threads/processes. However, these and other issues may also offer new opportunities to be explored in the design of methods and tools to improve the energy efficiency and performance of these systems.
