Nowadays, concurrent and distributed systems play a role in a variety of computing applications. This is supported by the widespread use of computing architectures based on multi-core processors and distributed computing units, which have become a standard de-facto at any system scale.

However, the increasing level of hardware parallelism and heterogeneity has made concurrent and distributed systems even more complex to design, analyze and optimize. In particular, this concerns performance and energy efficiency, which are known to be highly interrelated. Nonetheless, they play a key role, even because of the increasing global electricity demand by the IT sector.

In concurrent and distributed systems, energy efficiency and performance can be affected in a complex way by various factors, such as the concurrent use of computing resources, the distributed communication, the presence of (distributed) data dependencies and, ultimately, the need for synchronization of concurrent threads/processes. However, these and other factors also offer opportunities to be explored in the design of techniques and tools for improving energy efficiency and performance.
