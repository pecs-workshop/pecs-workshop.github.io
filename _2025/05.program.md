| | *Title: The CARM Tool: Cache-aware Roofline Model for HPC=CPU+GPU*
| | *Abstract: In recent years, HPC systems have become increasingly complex and heterogeneous, including CPUs and GPUs, and different programming models, making application development and optimization challenging. Performance models like the Cache-aware Roofline Model (CARM) offer effective guidance by providing insights into bottlenecks that limit the application's ability to reach the system's maximum performance. The focus of this talk is the CARM Tool, which was developed to provide CARM support, not only to all major CPU architectures and ISAs, i.e., x86 (Intel, AMD), ARM, and RISC-V, but also to GPUs (NVIDIA). The CARM tool also covers specialized accelerators for artificial intelligence, such as the NVIDIA Tensor Core, for the performance and efficiency characterization of deep learning workloads. The proposed tool includes automatically generated microbenchmarks, specifically tailored to cover both computational units and all memory hierarchy levels. Additionally, in this talk, I will showcase the deployment of CARM in the EuroHPC centers and present a short tutorial on the tool usage.*
