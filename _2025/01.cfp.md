PECS aims to establish a venue for both academia and industry to discuss challenges and perspectives, and to explore methods, techniques and tools for energy efficiency and performance analysis and optimization in concurrent and distributed systems.

PECS calls for high-quality research papers on all aspects of energy efficiency, performance and their interrelations in concurrent and/or distributed computing systems, focusing on (but not limited to) the following topics:

 - Energy efficiency and performance optimization in multi/many-core architectures 
 - Carbon efficiency and sustainable computing and system architectures
 - Energy efficiency and performance analysis and optimization in concurrent and distributed algorithms 
 - Analysis and optimization of energy efficiency and performance in distributed and heterogeneous computing architectures 
 - Parallel, concurrent and distributed programming approaches and tools for improving energy efficiency and performance 
 - Energy-efficient and performance optimized algorithms and frameworks for (Big) Data Processing, machine learning algorithms and AI applications 
 - Energy efficiency in high-performance computing platforms and applications 
 - Energy efficiency and performance aspects in Cloud, IoT, Edge and Fog Computing 
 - Approaches and techniques for improving energy efficiency and performance in data management and services 
 - Energy efficiency and performance evaluation and optimization in operating systems, networks and virtualized systems 
 - Energy impact evaluation and optimization in algorithms for security and their applications 



This edition is colocated with the 31th International European Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing ([Euro-PAR](https://2025.euro-par.org/)).
